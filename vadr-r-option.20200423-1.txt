The problem:

- Many incoming SARS-CoV-2 and other sequences (cox1) have stretches
  of Ns in them. Often these stretches of Ns are the correct length
  with respect to reference (presumably because they were added during
  a reference-based assembly).

- vadr/blast don't know what the Ns are supposed to be so homology
  detection and alignment performance/accuracy breaks down. This leads
  to various vadr errors (e.g. INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION)

- Further, vadr throws errors if start/stop codons are Ns.

- When a sequence has errors, the vadr output feature table gets
  populated with misc_features or incorrect annotation versus what it
  would have been IF the Ns were replaced by their expected nts.

- Indexers (Linda, Vince, Susan) have to spend a lot of manual work to
  get the annotation for these sequences and determine if they
  pass/fail.

- Of the 1204 SARS-CoV-2 seqs in GenBank as of 4/22/20, 93 have at
  least one stretch of more than 100 Ns, 146 have at least one >= 50
  Ns and 243 have a stretch of >= 10.

New -r option for replacing stretches of Ns:

How it works:
1. blastn is used to get the set of all compatible non-overlapping
   hits versus the RefSeq (or consensus sequence for cox1).

   input seq       xxxNNNxxxxxxxNNNNxxxxxxNNxxNNxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   NC_045512    ---xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx----

   blastn-hits     xxx   xxxxxxx    xxxxxx      xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   NC_045512       xxx   xxxxxxx    xxxxxx      xxxxxxxxxxxxx

   missing-regions    mmm       mmmm      mmmmmm
   NC_045512          xxx       xxxx      xxxxxx

2. Consider each missing region to see if it qualifies for replacing
   Ns. It must satisfy the following 3 criteria:

   A. missing sequence region must be at least 10 nt
      (controllable with --r_minlen)

   B. length missing sequence region must equal length of 
      missing RefSeq region (model length)
   
   C. missing sequence region must be >= 50% Ns
      (controllable with --r_minfract)

3. For each missing region that qualifies, all Ns in the region are
   replaced with the corresponding RefSeq/model nucleotide (only
   possible because criteria B was satisfied).

4. v-annotate.pl starts from the beginning as if the replaced
   sequences were the input sequences, and performs all four stages:
   classification, coverage determination, alignment and annotation,
   and protein validation. 

   Optionally, CDS and mature peptide-based errors (e.g. start/stop
   codon) can be detected based on original input sequences with
   --r_cdsmpo.

5. Sequences in output files (e.g. per-feature fasta files, and
   alignments) are fetched from the original input sequences, not the
   replaced ones.

Additional notes:
- -r can be used in combination with -s, often speeding things up further
  for SARS-CoV-2.

- step 1 can be done using cmsearch instead of blastn with --r_prof,
  although this doesn't seem to work as well for SARS-CoV-2 because
  cmsearch is more likely to extend across stretches of Ns than is
  blastn.

How many sequences pass/fail?

IGNORING LOW_SIMILARITY ERRORS:
(these are common because of differences at the ends of the sequences
that may or may not be artifacts)

vadr mode|  testset     | num pass | num fail 
---------|  ----------- | -------- | --------
default  |  903-testset | 897      | 6
-r       |  903-testset | 897      | 6
-s       |  903-testset | 900      | 3  (LOW_SCORE errors go away b/c blastn replaces cmsearch)
-s -r    |  903-testset | 900      | 3  (LOW_SCORE errors go away b/c blastn replaces cmsearch)

vadr mode|  testset     | num pass | num fail 
---------|  ----------- | -------- | --------
default  |  301-testset | 200      | 101
-r       |  301-testset | 290      |  11
-s       |  301-testset | 200      | 101
-s -r    |  301-testset | 290      |  11

Timing results:

As of 4/22/20, there were 1204 GenBank SARS-CoV-2 sequences listed
in this file:

https://bitbucket.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/scm/vv/2019-ncov.git/ncov-sequences.yaml

I broke them down into two sets for testing the -s option based on the
longest stretch of Ns in each sequence
- 903 (75%) of them do not have a stretch of more than 5 Ns
- 301 (25%) of them have at least one stretch of more that 5 Ns
